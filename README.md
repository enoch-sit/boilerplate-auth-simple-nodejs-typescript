Okay, I need to create a README for this authentication system project. Let me start by understanding what the user provided. The source code is for a TypeScript-based authentication system using MongoDB. It includes features like registration, login, token refresh, password reset, email verification, and protected routes. The user also included detailed documentation with setup instructions, project structure, configuration, models, services, authentication flow, and testing steps.

First, I should structure the README to be user-friendly and comprehensive. The existing documentation from the user is quite detailed, so I'll need to organize it into sections that are typical for a README, such as Overview, Features, Installation, Configuration, Usage, API Endpoints, Testing, Deployment, and License.

Starting with the title and a brief description. The title should be clear, like "Simple Authentication System with TypeScript and MongoDB". The description should summarize what the project does and its main features.

Next, the Features section can list the key functionalities: user registration, email verification, JWT authentication, password reset, protected routes, etc.

Installation steps are crucial. The user provided npm commands to install dependencies and set up the project. I'll need to present those in a clear step-by-step manner, maybe using code blocks.

Configuration is another important part. The user mentioned environment variables for development and production. I should explain how to set up the .env files and what each variable does.

The Project Structure section can outline the directories and their purposes, based on the provided structure. Maybe using a tree diagram or a list.

For the API Endpoints, the user included routes for auth and protected routes. I should list each endpoint, its method, purpose, and example request. Maybe a table for clarity.

Testing instructions are provided with curl commands. I can include those examples so users know how to test the system after installation.

Deployment considerations should mention using MongoDB Atlas, AWS SES, and Docker. The user provided some notes on production setup, so I'll summarize those.

Including a section about the Technologies Used would be helpful, listing TypeScript, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, Nodemailer, etc.

License information is necessary. The user didn't specify, so I might need to ask, but assuming MIT for now.

I should also add a section for Contributing if others might want to contribute, but since the user didn't mention it, maybe skip it unless necessary.

Finally, ensure the README flows logically from setup to usage, with clear headings and subheadings. Use markdown formatting for code blocks, lists, and tables to make it readable.

Wait, the user provided a lot of Mermaid diagrams and tables in their original content. Should I include those? The original answer might have been part of the source code documentation. For the README, maybe simplify and avoid too many diagrams, unless they add significant value. But the sequence diagrams for registration and login flow could be useful to understand the system.

Alternatively, convert some of the Mermaid diagrams into text descriptions for better readability in the README, which is usually viewed on GitHub where Mermaid might not render unless the repo has that support.

Also, check for any redundant information. The user's original content has a lot of details, but the README should be concise. Maybe summarize the architecture and flow without all the code.

Including a Quick Start section would help users get running quickly. The user had a "Quick Setup" section with npm commands; that should be highlighted.

I need to make sure all steps are clear, such as setting up MongoDB and MailHog for development. Provide commands for different OS where necessary.

Putting it all together, the README should guide a user from cloning the repo to running the server and testing endpoints. Make sure to mention prerequisites like Node.js, npm, MongoDB, and MailHog.

Also, include notes about environment variables, maybe with example .env files, but caution users not to commit secrets.

Finally, add a section on how to contribute or report issues, and a license.

Let me start drafting the sections based on these thoughts.




# Simple Authentication System with TypeScript and MongoDB

A robust authentication system built with TypeScript, Express, and MongoDB. Features include user registration, email verification, JWT authentication, password reset, and protected routes.

## Features

• **User Registration**: Secure signup with email verification
• **JWT Authentication**: Access and refresh tokens with expiration
• **Email Integration**: Verification emails and password reset functionality
• **Protected Routes**: Middleware for authenticated endpoints
• **Password Management**: Secure hashing and reset functionality
• **Database Integration**: MongoDB for data persistence
• **Environment Configuration**: Separate settings for development and production

## Technologies

• **Backend**: Node.js, Express
• **Language**: TypeScript
• **Database**: MongoDB, Mongoose
• **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
• **Email**: Nodemailer (MailHog for development, AWS SES for production)
• **Security**: Helmet, rate limiting, CORS
• **Logging**: Winston

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

• Node.js (v18+)
• MongoDB (Local or Atlas)
• npm

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/enoch-sit/boilerplate-auth-simple-nodejs-typescript.git
   cd boilerplate-auth-simple-nodejs-typescript
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   • Create `.env.development` and `.env.production` files in the root directory.
   • Use the templates provided in the project documentation.

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable                | Description                          | Example                   |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `MONGO_URI`             | MongoDB connection string            | `mongodb://localhost:27017/auth` |
| `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`     | Secret key for access tokens         | `your_access_secret`      |
| `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`    | Secret key for refresh tokens        | `your_refresh_secret`     |
| `EMAIL_HOST`            | SMTP server host                     | `smtp.mailservice.com`    |
| `EMAIL_PORT`            | SMTP server port                     | `587`                     |
| `EMAIL_USER`            | SMTP username                        | `user@example.com`        |
| `EMAIL_PASS`            | SMTP password                        | `password123`            |

### Email Setup

• **Development**: Use MailHog (included in Docker setup)
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 1025:1025 -p 8025:8025 mailhog/mailhog
  ```
• **Production**: Configure AWS SES or another SMTP service.

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                | Method | Description                     |
|-------------------------|--------|---------------------------------|
| `/api/auth/signup`      | POST   | Register a new user             |
| `/api/auth/login`       | POST   | Login with credentials          |
| `/api/auth/refresh`     | POST   | Refresh access token            |
| `/api/auth/verify-email`| POST   | Verify email with token         |
| `/api/profile`         | GET    | Get user profile (Protected)    |
| `/api/reset-password`   | POST   | Reset password with token       |

## Testing

### Register a User

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser","email":"test@example.com","password":"Password123!"}'
```

### Verify Email (Check MailHog UI at `http://localhost:8025`)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/verify-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"token":"ABC123"}'
```

### Login

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser","password":"Password123!"}'
```

### Access Protected Route

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## Deployment

### Production Considerations

1. **Database**: Use MongoDB Atlas for a managed MongoDB service.
2. **Email**: Configure AWS SES in `.env.production`.
3. **HTTPS**: Use a reverse proxy (Nginx) or cloud provider (AWS, Heroku).
4. **Environment Variables**: Store secrets securely (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager).

### Docker

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
